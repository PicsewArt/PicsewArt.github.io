i wish i didn’t love you. i wish my heart would stop aching for you. i wish i’d stop dreaming about your warms arms around me. face buried in my neck. whispering you love me as you fall asleep.
i wish i didn’t crave you. i wish i could tear off my skin. i threw everything away. even the empty water bottle you bought me on our first date. i wish i could stop loving you.

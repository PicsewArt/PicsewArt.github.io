Laying here, thinking of you.

The house is quiet. The air is still. But inside my chest, my heart gallops as I imagine feeling your warmth next to me. Half hoping, half frightened of how that would feel in reality.

I hope you’ll join me on my next adventure. 2021 could be our year. Let’s drive into the sunset and never look back.

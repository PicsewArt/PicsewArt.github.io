Dear you, 

I just want to fill that void of emptiness if only for a little while. 

I know I’m going to regret it but for a just a little while I might not care, I might not be sad, I might not feel the pain and anguish, I might not miss you, no it’s not possible. 

If only I could forget, forget what I had, forget what I lost, just for a little while at least. 

From me x

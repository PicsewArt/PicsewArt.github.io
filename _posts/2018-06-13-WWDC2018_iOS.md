WWDC 2018 Summary for iOS developers.

## What's new in Xcode 10

* An ability to launch `XCTest` and `XCUITest` in parallel, so you can run your test suite on multiple simulators at once. That reduces the test execution dramatically.
* `xcodebuild` enhancements. For example, you can upload an app to App Store from the `xcodebuild` tool or run control the behavior of parallel testing.
* Ability to create custom code snippets for any language and reuse them whenever needed.
* Dark mode, which you can switch on from System Preferences. You can also switch your app in and out of Dark Mode while debugging or right in the Interface Builder.
* Newly-created schemes are now shared by all users of an Xcode project.
* Supports of multi-cursor editing in Source Editor, which allows you to quickly edit multiple lines of code simultaneously.
* Default build system activation, where the new build system provides improved reliability and build performance, and it catches project configuration problems.
* Source Control workflow enhancements. For example, integration with source code collaboration platforms (GitHub/GitHub Enterprise, Bitbucket Cloud/Bitbucket Server, GitLab/GitLab self-hosted), ability to resolve merge conflicts or create ssh keys directly from Xcode. Also, you’ll be pleased with the improved look of changes highlight with more in-depth information on the actual commit message.
* Source Editor in Xcode 10 now supports an overscroll!
* Code folding got dramatic improvements with an ability to fold almost anything. Also, using code folding ribbon it’s easier to do it via interface.

## What's new in Swift 4.2

* Dynamic member look up to provide dot syntax for subscripts. That helps iOS developers to write type-safe code.
* Random number generation and shuffling, when Swift 4.2 add a random API to the standard library.
* Ability to check whether all elements in a `Sequence` satisfied a certain condition.
* Conditional conformances improvements. For example, Swift 4.2 adds a default implementation for `Equatable` conditional conformance to an extension and implements dynamic queries of conditional conformances.
* `Hashable` enhancements. With Swift 4.2 you can use newly introduced `Hasher` struct with convenient API to build your hash value in a more secure way.
* Warning and error diagnostic directives. Embrace `#warning` and `#error` directives to add more explicit error/warning message to compiler output.
* Boolean toggling. Simple but powerful function to toggle Bool value `toggle()` is now a part of Standard Library.

## What's new in Cocoa Touch

* Scroll performance improved. Data prefetch method now being executed serially instead of concurrently.
* Memory performance. Automatic Backing Store which reduced Bytes Per Pixel amount depending on the images that needs to be rendered.
* Improved structure for emuns like `UIApplicationState` changing them to `UIApplication.State` to better represent the meaning.
* String conversions functions (`NSStringFromCGRect()...`) now is accessible as codable. Also, these functions are now moved to NSCoder to better represent the end goals.
* Notifications. Pre-defined set of actions for custom notifications is no longer static and could be defined programmatically.
* An ability to bring your custom stickers pack to Messages and to Camera.
* Automatic passwords and auto-fill.

## What's new in ARKit 2.0

* Support for a new `USDZ` file format to export 3D models and render them in AR.
* AR objects browser for displaying 3D models and rendering the same 3D model in AR mode.
* Real-world objects detection in AR with a new tracking configuration, `ARObjectScanningConfiguration`.
* Objects detection with with the ARReferenceImage and ARReferenceObject classes.

* Siri Shortcuts, which are actions Siri can predict and provide to the user in places such as Spotlight search, Lock Screen etc.
* HealthKit, which lets users share their medical history with your app.
* New Network framework, that makes it easier to create network connections to send and receive data using transport and security protocols.
* Updated Natural Language framework designed to provide high-performance, on-device APIs for fundamental NLP tasks.
* Notifications improvements: grouping capabilities and ability to deep link directly into your app’s notification settings from an incoming one via providesAppNotificationSettings.
* UIKit Additions: extended password autofill APIs, one time TFA codes, better Graphics Rendering.

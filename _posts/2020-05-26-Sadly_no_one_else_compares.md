I’m missing right now.

I miss your smile, your eyes and your free spirit personality. I shouldn’t miss you after all these years. But here I am having that heartbreaking feeling, the one where I know we will never see each other again. Our paths won’t cross accidentally. I’m never going to learn the things that make you, you. I can’t make you laugh. Can’t make you smile. Nothing. I miss you.

I realized that you’re actually my person, that’s unlikely to ever change. No one compares, past or present. Likely no one else will even compare in the future.

Take care, I will always love you. I know that now.

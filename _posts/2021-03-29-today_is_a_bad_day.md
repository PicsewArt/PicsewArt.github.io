I should have been less needy. I should have been less insecure. I should have adjusted my needs to what you were able and willing to give. I should have felt more gratitude toward the efforts you made. I should have modified my way of interacting with you. It was all my fault. No wonder youâ€™ve given up trying to hold me. No wonder you let me go. There were sharks everywhere at the bookstore today. All I wanted was to send you pictures.

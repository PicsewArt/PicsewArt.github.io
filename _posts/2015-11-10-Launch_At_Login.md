To have the app launch start at login you just need to call `SMLoginItemSetEnabled` with your bundle ID and bool value.

```objc
SMLoginItemSetEnabled ((__bridge CFStringRef)@"com.domain.example", YES) // NO to cancel launch at login
```

You need `ServiceManagement` framework to access this API.

This is not a private API so you can use this and submit your apps to App Store.

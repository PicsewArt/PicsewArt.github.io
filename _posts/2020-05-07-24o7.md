You have done things to positively change my view on the world on an astronomical level. I've never had feelings like this before. I finally don't feel alone. You just make me feel better and I try to do the same. You trust me enough to tell me extremely personal things. You go through too much. You don't deserve it. You are such a sweet soul and you bounce around in my head all the time, like a dvd logo in an old tv. Your whole aura just radiates the best energy I have ever felt. It breaks my heart to know that you silently had to go through that while I had no idea. I wish you would have told me earlier. I could have done something. I would have done something. I don’t understand why they did that. I could never tell these words to you in person, so here I am, typing shit onto a post in hopes you see it.

Instructions on how to transfer data from one microSD card to another for use on Nintendo Switch.

### Additional Information:

* Software downloaded to a microSD card on one system will not be playable on a different system.
* **Do not** swap data between multiple microSD cards, or swap your microSD card between multiple systems. Use a single microSD card with one system and be sure to follow the steps below if transferring content to a new microSD card.
* **Do not** overwrite data by recopying to the same microSD card.
* Always copy the entire folder, and never alter or erase the files it contains.

### What You Need:

* Two compatible microSD cards. The following types of microSD cards are supported on Nintendo Switch:
  * microSD (up to 2 GB)
  * microSDHC (4 GB - 32 GB)
  * microSDXC (64 GB and above)
    * **Important**: In order to use a microSDXC card on the Nintendo Switch console, a system update is required.

* An SD card slot on a PC or Mac or a commercially available microSD card reader/writer.
  * If your PC or Mac does not have a microSD card slot you will need a card adapter.

3. Open Windows Explorer (for PC) or Finder (for Mac) and access the microSD card.
4. Highlight the data and drag it to the desktop.
  * If you are moving your content to a new microSD card, be sure to first format the new card per [our recommendations](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/).
  * **Do not delete, format, or alter the content from the original microSD card until you have verified the new microSD card is working correctly.**
  * Once the new card has been formatted, continue with the instructions below.
5. Eject the first microSD card, then insert the second microSD card into the slot or reader/writer.
6. Using Windows Explorer or Finder access the microSD card again.

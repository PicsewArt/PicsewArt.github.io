I wish I could tell you everything on my mind. I’ve been dying to. I’ve been dying to let it out, let you know. But there’s something inside me holding me back. An excuse, a fear, an anxiety. I like to think of what things might be like if I could talk to you, what might change if you knew. Would my fear of rejection be realized? Or would we grow together like I wish we would?

Since you’ve come into my life, things have felt brighter. The overcast that is the sky of my life has learned what it’s like to see the sun. Your smile stops the rain, your laugh warms my skin more than the our star ever has. I can’t thank you enough for that. You’ve shown me how much more there is to everything, even if you don’t know it. All I want is a chance to return the favor, and to show you what you’ve shown me.

Would you let me show you the sun?

The excitement of this is addicting.

The process of getting to know someone new, letting you into my stream of consciousness as you share from yours, is addicting. It's the intellect and the wit that intrigued me to start, I genuinely could sit and listen to you dive into your excited explanations for hours. It's the warmth of your smile and the genuine kindness in your eyes when we talk through the less than happy things. It's the furrowed brow and slight lean away as you get ready to share something new. It's so many little quirks that make me smile and want to curl up with you and talk for hours more.

I warned you if you kept it up you'd have me falling for you, so I hope you're okay with that.

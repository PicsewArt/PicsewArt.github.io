I need to feel you again, but better, closer. Just us.

I want see the energy with my eyes. You find me something I can’t get from anyone else. And I fear I’m becoming depleted from the Magic you gift me. I’m sure if I dig deep enough it might find a reserve set aside for emergencies. But you pull out all the magic up to the surface without even trying, and I don’t ever want to forget how you move me, how you’ve changed me. You’re the only one who’s ever spoken to me without words. Can we do that again?

I want to explore all the dimensions with you. We’ve already seen a few. How far can we go?

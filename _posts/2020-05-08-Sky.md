The sky is full

Of swirling color:

Pinks and oranges

And yellow-hued quiet;

Every morning you

Choose distance

Is another that pulls

Me into dreams that

Aren’t called your name

And don’t play

Our song;

Know that I’m a bird

And I rather love

The endless

And the free,

And I may already

Be soaring

Further than your reach

Should you ever

Extend

Your hand

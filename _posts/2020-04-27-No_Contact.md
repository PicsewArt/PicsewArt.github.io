I know why. And understand that this is how it has to be.

My silence is because I love you. Not because I don’t.

I’ll always miss you.

And that's sad.

Tonight was a little rough and I thought about how I really wished you were still apart of my life. I didn’t realize how long it’s been till now and I hope you’re doing okay.

Next time I see you, I think we'll walk downtown in the rain.

I think I'll get you somewhere alone and say, "Can I kiss you?"

I think I'll be nervous enough to cry. But after all these years of missing you, it will be worth all the risk if you'll nod your head and let me.

More than anything I just hope you'll let me hug you and ask how you've been.

It's really not the same without you here.

As tears streamed down your face in our last few hours together and you sobbed into my chest, I wanted to say it so bad. So badly that I didn't know if I would be able to keep the words from spilling out. But I knew you had chosen to end our relationship for a reason. It wouldn't be fair to you, no matter how much I wanted you to say yes. It would break your heart having to say no, knowing that's the answer you needed to give right now. I didn't want to make it harder on you. I love you too much for that. You asked me if there was anything else I wanted to talk about, anything else I wanted to say. I told you that no, I had told you everything. That was a lie. There was one more thing.

> Tell me you want me to stay and I won't go.

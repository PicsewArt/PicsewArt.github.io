Almost every morning I wake up having had an amazing dream with you in it before I come back to the sad reality of life. We can’t be together and it still sucks. It seems like my feelings for you have been getting stronger rather than weaker in the absence of seeing you. How is that possible? How is it possible that I’m even more sure now than ever that what we had wasn’t just infatuation but love?

I miss our intimate late night conversations, I miss feeling the flutter in my heart I got from a simple “hey”, and mostly I miss someone I was so close to for so long. I wonder if you even think of me anymore since you don’t seem to want to talk. I wish I had your apparent strength and ability to move on with life. Maybe starting something new has helped you in a way that I can’t realize. Whatever the case I want you to be happy even if it’s at the expense of my happiness.

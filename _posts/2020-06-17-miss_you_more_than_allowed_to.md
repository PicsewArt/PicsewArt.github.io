I think I miss you more than I am allowed to.

I can't tell if it's because the world is rotting in its own decay, or that you have now someone else, or the spillage of my drunken fantasy of what we could've been into the front of my mind or the grass is simply greener when you're in the arms of someone else. But I meant that. I hear your smile in every song I sing and film I see that I know you might like. But things fall back from where they're from; I remain in a love so stable, as you probably do too.

I guess it's just the emptiness and the wonder of being apart from someone who felt much like my true self.

And if there is a count for how many times you genuinely connect with another soul, like 9 lives & 3 wishes; there goes one.

There goes you.

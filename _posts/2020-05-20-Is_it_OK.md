I know things have changed. we've both turned our pages, started new chapters. But I just wanted to ask, is it okay I stay hopeful? Is it okay to still want my ending to be written alongside yours?

You can tell me if it's not okay. Tell me you don't want it to be me. Or that you can visualize your life without me in it, ever again. Say those words and i’ll understand it’s not okay.

All I have are the memories of the months we spent together. Those are the glue that is barely holding my life together. You moved on. I don't blame you, I was (am) a wreck.

Who am I underneath? My former self is long gone. I drank him away.

You are an angel. I'm happy to know that for a short while we meant something to each other.

I don't think anything could be that good again.

I'm grateful for everything you did for me. Everything we did together. Everything we could have done together.

Yours, always and forever.

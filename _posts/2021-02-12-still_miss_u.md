We didn't get a lot of time, but I really miss what we had. I miss all of it. Spending time with you, making you laugh and making you feel loved. I miss looking into your eyes and feeling safe and comfortable.

I wish I could still spend time with you and talk to you every day, I've felt so isolated and lonely without you. There were so many things I wanted to do with you that can't happen now, and it hurts so much. I'm feeling considerably better now, but every now and then I still feel like I'm being pushed down by something I can't see.

I'm so sorry I couldn't give you what you needed. I really am happy for you that you have it now and I hope you'll have it for a long time, but it hurts that I couldn't be the one for you.

I'm sorry I wasted your time, trying to hold on to something that wouldn't work and stopping you from getting what you want and need.

I still love you and I always will, and I hope you're doing alright.

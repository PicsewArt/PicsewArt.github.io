It's me again.

I’m not sure why you have such a strong hold on my heart. I went years without thoughts of you. Now it seems not a day goes by that you don’t enter my thoughts. I can’t help but wonder if you miss me as much as I miss you. I forgave you for the broken heart. Maybe we just weren’t meant to be together?

I know that I wear my heart on my sleeve and I’m a hopeless romantic. But thoughts of us being together fill my dreams.

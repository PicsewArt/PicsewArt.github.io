I can’t pinpoint why you’re special. I can’t pinpoint why I think of you Every. Single. Day.

I’ve done dating apps; I’ve talked to so many other people that aren’t you! So tell me why I can only think about you!

Tell me why I’m craving your words, your sense of humor, your goofy ass.

Tell me why no one has replaced you so far.

I want to see you - at 10 feet apart, of course.

But it’s you and it’s only. Fucking. You.

I hate that, but I like you.

You get me and understand me.

But this is all I can do.

I miss you, dearly,

Me.

Become the king of Saints Row with these cheats for Saints Row The Third.

# Saints Row 3 cheats

Saints Row is a ludicrous open world action series about doing ludicrous things with ludicrous powers (and, also, dildo bats). Abilities you unlock throughout Saints Row the Third let you sprint forever, reload guns instantly, and walk away from explosions without a scratch, but it doesn't have the fourth game's crazy super powers, which give you telekinesis and let you super jump across the world. With these Saints Row 3 cheats, however, you can still play god.

The Saints Row the Third cheats below let you spawn in weapons and vehicles, and also let you manipulate some of the game's major systems. You can change the weather, earn instant gang notoriety, or turn all the pedestrians into zombies.

As far as we know, these Saints Row 3 cheats will all work in Saints Row the Third Remastered the same as they do in the original game. Here's how to use them, and all the codes you need to know.

# How to use Saints Row the Third cheats

Inputting these cheat codes in Saints Row 3 is simple. In-game, pull up your cell phone (Tab on keyboard, Back button on Xbox controller). Select Extras and then Cheats. That's rightâ€”there's a dedicated cheats menu.

Select Cheats, click Add Cheats, and then type in one of the cheat codes below and click Accept. And that's it. Cheat added.
